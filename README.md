# ESP8266_ISSPointer

Servo driven International Space Station (ISS) Tracking Pointer

Overview

Expanding on my Stepper Motor controller using Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266 WiFi module by adding a small Servo, I created a mechanical device that can move in Azimuth (using a Stepper) and Altitude (using a Servo). This makes for a compact and low-cost remotely controlled celestial pointer. In this case, it can be used to point at the International Space Station (ISS) as it flies overhead.
